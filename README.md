# Diceware-Password-Generation

This is a project containing files for generating a password in the Diceware format. The password is roughly human-readable, but contains enough entropy to be reasonably secure. 

Running the file "Diceware password generator.py" is enough to run the program. "Copy from pdf of words.txt" is a straight copy-and-paste of a PDF file containing the source words. "Prepare the text file.py" and "Diceware words.txt" are the script and output used to make the source words more processable.
